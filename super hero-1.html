        <h4>Who is Batwoman?</h4>
        <p><p style="color:#0E6655;">Kate Kane, Batwoman, is one of the most strong-willed characters in comics. When it comes to standing for what she believes in, her convictions, and the protection of others, there may be none better. And it’s precisely this combination that makes her a lock for this list.

Batwoman has become a symbol for anybody who has ever been told that they can’t, shouldn’t, or otherwise. Each and every day she shows the world that it’s ok to be who you were born to be. She is a trailblazer and because of her efforts, doors that were previously locked tight have opened up.
