        <h4>Who is Black Widow?</h4>
        <p><p style="color:#A569BD";>Black Widow got a huge surge in popularity with her many appearances in the MCU. That’s not to say her popularity wasn’t t warranted. It’s quite the opposite.

Black Widow helped pave the way for a new generation of female superheroes. She’s as deadly as she is beautiful and through extensive training, is one of the foremost assassins in all of comics. 

Black Widow is one of the best female superheroes because she needs to be. No, scratch that. Black Widow is one of the best female superheroes because she has inspired girls all over the world to want and do more.
