        <h4>Who is Storm?</h4>
        <p>Spoiler alert…as you’ll see, Jean Grey is the most important female member of the X-Men. But don’t discount Storm. She’s a very close second. What separates Storm from many on this list is that her morals and convictions cannot be swayed. She, like Charles Xavier, believes that humans and mutants can live in harmony. As such, she spends her life fighting for her beliefs.

Storm is a mutant whose powers allow her absolute control over the weather. She can make it snow one minute and during the next minute have a tsunami crush a city. The only thing holding her back from placing higher on this list is Marvel’s apprehension in showing just how powerful she is in their movies.
