        <h4>Who is Zatanna ?</h4>
        <p><p style="color:#922B21";>Debuting in 1964, Zatanna has rocketed into becoming one of the most recognizable and loved characters in comics. She is one of the most powerful sorceresses in DC and as such, she’s capable of standing up to just about anyone. Her character is so popular that it’s a wonder why DC hasn’t capitalized on her success. Not only could she carry a movie but is there a better way, outside of Justice League Dark, to introduce the supernatural side of DC? DC should take a page from Marvel. If they made Dr. Strange work in film, there’s no reason that DC can’t make Zatanna work.
